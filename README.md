# 👤 Who?

**FossPixel** is being developed by me and a few fellow aspiring developers as part of our indie dev team - **LunaTech**.

# ❓ What?

GIMP is still not a fully viable replacement for Photoshop or Illustrator for the average user. We're working to change that with **FossPixel**.

# 🗓️ When?

We’re aiming to release **beta builds** later this year or early next. With community feedback, we'll refine and improve. As for a full release - we’re a small team, so expect at least a year or two. Thanks for being patient!

# 🌐 Where?

The **source code** will be available right here on this **GitHub repo**. The official **FossPixel website** is in the works — once it's live, it’ll host download links and updates. For now, keep checking back here!

# 🤔 Why?

We kind of already explained this… but yeah, we want a real, free alternative to Adobe tools that doesn’t suck.

# 🛠️ How?

Uhhh... **development?** Obviously. 😅

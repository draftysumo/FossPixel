# 👤 Who?

**FossPixel** is being developed by me (@Draftysumo) along with some colleagues & whoever wants to contribute.

# ❓ What?

GIMP is still not a fully viable replacement for Photoshop EVEN AFTER 20 YEARS OF INCEPTION so I'm doing it myself 😎

# 🗓️ When?

I'm aiming to release **beta builds** later this year or early next. With community feedback, I'll refine and improve. As for a full release - we’re a small team, so expect at least a year or two. Thanks for being patient!

# 🌐 Where?

The **source code** will be available right here on this **GitHub repo**. The official **FossPixel website** is in the works - once it's live, it’ll host download links and updates. For now, keep checking back here!

# 🤔 Why?

We kind of already explained this… but yeah, we want a real, **free alternative** to Adobe tools that doesn’t **suck**. Especially ones avaliable for **Linux**.

# 🛠️ How?

**FossPixel** is developed on **Linux!** specifically Ubuntu Desktop. FossPixel is **tested on all major OS's** and hardware to ensure it functions **correctly** no matter what device its running on.

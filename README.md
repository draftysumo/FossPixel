# 🎨 FossPixel (In Development)

Looking for a **free** alternative to Photoshop or Lightroom? **FossPixel** is a powerful, open-source image editing and photo tweaking tool. It's designed to replicate the core features you love from Adobe’s flagship products in an easy-to-understand UI — all **without** the price tag.

But FossPixel isn’t just “another editor.” It’s the **final step in your open-source creative workflow** — the place where everything comes together. Import your vectors from **Inkscape**, your pixel art from **PixieEditor**, your illustrations from **Krita**, and your photos from anywhere else, then finish them here. FossPixel is where you **combine, refine, heal, and polish** your creations into their final form.

## 👤 Who?

FossPixel is being built by me (@Draftysumo), a few colleagues, and anyone in the community who wants to contribute.

## ❓ What?

After more than 20 years, GIMP still hasn’t become a true Photoshop replacement. So I decided to make one myself 😎 — with a little help from existing FOSS tools.

## 🗓️ When?

Expect the first beta builds later this year or early next. With your feedback, we’ll refine and improve.
A stable release will take longer — we’re a small team, so realistically it’ll be at least a year or two. Thanks for your patience!

## 🌐 Where?

The source code lives here on GitHub.
An official FossPixel website is also in the works — once it’s live, it’ll host downloads, updates, and community resources. Until then, keep an eye on this repo.

## 🤔 Why?

Because the FOSS creative world deserves a real alternative to Adobe tools — one that doesn’t suck, and one that works on Linux as well as everywhere else.

FossPixel isn’t here to replace Inkscape, Krita, or PixieEditor. Instead, it aims to bridge the gaps between them, giving creators a unified finishing studio to bring all their work together.

## 🛠️ How?

FossPixel is developed on Ubuntu Desktop, but tested across all major operating systems and hardware to ensure it runs smoothly everywhere.
